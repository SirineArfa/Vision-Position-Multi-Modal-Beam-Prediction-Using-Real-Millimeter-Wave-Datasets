## About the work

This work is related to the following article:

Jo√£o Morais, and Ahmed Alkhateeb, "Position Aided Beam prediction: How useful GPS locations actually are?".

where we will use KNN- K Nearest Neighbors to predicted the beam indexes of the Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication system.

## The Dataset

The data consists of Scenarios 1-9 of DeepSense6G dataset.

## Code Package Content:

You can find the folder that contains the 9 scenarios at "All_9_scenarios_datasets" folder.

In order to reproduce the work you should:

1. Run pip install -r requirements.txt (Python 2), or pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3) to install all the requirements
2. Run python KNN_model.py
